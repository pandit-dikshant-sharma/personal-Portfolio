#Dikshant Sharma - Personal portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, certifications, and professional journey. Designed with simplicity and clarity, the website highlights my expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. It also includes links to my major projects, blog posts, and contact details. I will continue to update it as I grow and learn in my career.
